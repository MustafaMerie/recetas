## Reflection

This was one week long project built during Weekends. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

Originally I wanted to build an application that allowed users to add their recipes in one organized place so they can never lose or forget and share it with others. I started this process by using the `create-react-app` boilerplate, then adding `react-router` and `contextAPI`.
